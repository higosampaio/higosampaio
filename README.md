I entered the world of technology in 2009 through university. I have a bachelor's degree in Information Systems and also a MBA degree in Software Engineering. In this academic environment I had my first professional opportunities, collaborating in scientific laboratories and educational projects. I have been developing myself as a Software Engineer for 10 years, participating in important projects in companies such as: UOL, Compass, Getnet, PagoNxt, Santander, Grupo Mateus and others.

I am currently part of the largest e-commerce technology company in Latin America. We dream of democratizing commerce and money to impact development and people's lives.

Cheers! â˜•
