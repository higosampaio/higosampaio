### Hi, I'm Higo!

I have been working with web development since 2012 and over time I had opportunities to learn as a developer and tech lead. Today I’m working on the Pulse engineering team, with the responsibility of promoting and maintaining architectural standards for front-end teams. Currently I focus my studies on JavaScript specifications and some frameworks.

In my free time I like being with family 👪, playing sports ⚽, traveling 🏖️, enjoying good music 🎵and good food 🍤.

I learned that we are in a constantly changing market and we need to respond to that more than following a plan.
